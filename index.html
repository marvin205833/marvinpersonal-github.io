                                                November 2019. Dardoch is as talented as he is notorious; despite
                                                being
                                                recognized as
                                                one of the most talented junglers in North America since his rookie
                                                split,
                                                he is also known as one of the region’s most contentious players.
                                                After
                                                a disastrous split on Team Liquid where his brashness and hunger to
                                                win put him at odds with his teammates and coaches, his career has
                                                been
                                                shrouded with infamy. Nevertheless, such a reputation only makes
                                                Dardoch the ideal TSM jungler - the only LCS position with enough
                                                notoriety to match him. With his top tier mechanical skill and
                                                jungle
                                                sense,
                                                perhaps he will be able to find vindication on TSM - not just for
                                                himself, but for the role he’s taken up as well.

                                                playing his rookie split on TSM during which the team finished top
                                                of
                                                the league with a 17-1 record and steamrolled the competition during
                                                playoffs. Following that split, he stayed on the team for an

                                be a part of the organization’s Rocket League team. He started playing Rocket League
                                in
                                early 2016, quickly climbing to the Top 100 of the ranked 1v1 leaderboards and
                                coming in
                                2nd in his first 1v1 tournament. After this, he started to bounce around playing for
                                different teams until qualifying for the RLCS in Season 3. Since then, he has made
                                top 3

                                every major tournament in 2017. He considers himself highly skilled at adapting to
